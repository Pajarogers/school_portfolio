            <p>My objective was to create a user-friendly and engaging financial literacy application for children aged 7-12. The problem is the lack of accessible, age-appropriate financial education tools for this demographic.</p>

        <h3>Analysis:</h3>
        <p> <span>Target Audience:</span> In my research, I explored numerous educational websites dedicated to financial literacy for kids. Most of these sites were designed for children aged 12 and older. This discovery guided my focus on creating a tailored financial literacy platform for a younger audience, aged 7-12, to meet their distinct learning requirements. </p>
        <p>During my research, I came across a helpful website called "SuperSquad" designed for younger kids. This discovery was instrumental in analyzing and understanding the progress made in the field of financial literacy for children.</p>
